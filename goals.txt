My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

I would love to join Patten University in California and start my journey toward earning a degree. My goal for next year is to build a strong foundation in software engineering, stay consistent with my classes, and push myself to understand the core skills I’ll need in the tech world. I want to take advantage of the learning support the school offers so I can grow, stay on track, and become confident in real-world projects by the end of the year.
